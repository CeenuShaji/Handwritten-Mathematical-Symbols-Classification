# Final Project

This is a **group assignment**.

## Code Implementation & Technical Report

The final deliverables include a 4-page IEEE-format report, code implementation and a detailed GitHub readme file.

The final project is due Tuesday, December 6 @ 11:59 PM. Find the complete [rubric](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/455013/assignments/5244219) in the Canvas assignment.

## Training Data

The training data set is the same for every team in this course.

You can download the training data from the Canvas page:

## About The Project

This is a final group project for Fundamentals of Machine Learning class in which we were tasked with developing a machine learning system to classify handwritten mathematical symbols. The dataset used for this project was collected by each student enrolled in this course and contains a variety of 10 symbols. Our group, team square root implemented YOLOv5 for classification of the symbols and object detection. In this, we were able to train the model and make predictions of the test with an accuracy score above 90%.
