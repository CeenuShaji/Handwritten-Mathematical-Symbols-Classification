# Final Project

This is a **group assignment**.

## Code Implementation & Technical Report

The final deliverables include a 4-page IEEE-format report, code implementation and a detailed GitHub readme file.

The final project is due Tuesday, December 6 @ 11:59 PM. Find the complete [rubric](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/455013/assignments/5244219) in the Canvas assignment.

## Training Data

## About The Project

This is a group project for Fundamentals of Machine Learning class in which we were tasked with developing a machine learning system to classify handwritten mathematical symbols. The dataset used for this project was collected by each student enrolled in this course and contains a variety of 10 symbols. 

## Getting Started

The YOLOv5 repository needs to be cloned in order for the model to run.
